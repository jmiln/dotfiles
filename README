Directions:

Run install-packages.sh
Run createLinks.sh

Tmux plugin manager:
 - https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm#installation

NVM (Node version manager):
 - https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
 - Run `nvm install node`

Generally after node is installed, I install eslint & pm2
 - npm i -g eslint pm2

For Exa, manual installation seems to be required, since the apt version doesn't support git
